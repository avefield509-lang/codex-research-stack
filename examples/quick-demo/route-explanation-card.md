# Route Explanation Card

## Task Type

`computational-social-science`

## Selected Profile

Research project profile with literature, platform evidence, coding, analysis, writing, and reproducibility checks.

## Selected Components

- VELA route layer: explains the route and decides whether the task should become project-type work.
- Coordination layer: creates inspectable project roles, context packets, handoff logs, and gate files.
- `citation-verifier`: prevents unverified references from becoming formal citations.
- `social-platform-reader`: handles browser-visible platform evidence without pretending hidden data is available.
- `text-analysis`: supports qualitative coding and text-based synthesis.
- `reproducibility-package`: keeps project files, scripts, inputs, and outputs organized for later inspection.

## Why These Components

The task mixes literature, platform evidence, coding, and reproducibility. A single free-form answer would hide too many decisions. The safer path is to make the route, roles, and review points visible before execution.

## Excluded Components

- `latex-paper-conversion`: not needed because the task is not a journal-template conversion.
- `reviewer-response-pack`: not needed because there are no reviewer comments yet.
- `long-running-experiment-ops`: not needed because no batch experiment is being launched.

## Next Step

Create a project dispatch with a literature producer, an analysis producer, a project manager, and a reviewer gate.
