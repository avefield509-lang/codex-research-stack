# 3-Minute Quick Demo

This demo shows the smallest useful story behind Codex Research Stack.

The question it answers is:

**What happens after a researcher gives Codex a real project-shaped task?**

## The Scenario

A researcher wants to start a computational social science project:

- topic: public reactions to AI-generated content labels
- materials: platform posts, comments, and academic literature
- expected outputs: a small evidence map, a coding plan, and a reproducibility-ready project folder

This is not just one answer. It has literature, platform evidence, analysis, writing, and review risk. So the stack should not immediately produce a polished essay. It should first explain the route.

## The Demo Flow

1. The user gives a project prompt.
2. `research-autopilot` explains the route.
3. `research-team-orchestrator` turns the route into project roles.
4. A reviewer gate checks whether the output can move forward.
5. The project state files show where the work stands.

## Files To Read In Order

1. [`demo-prompt.md`](./demo-prompt.md)
2. [`route-explanation-card.md`](./route-explanation-card.md)
3. [`research-map.md`](./research-map.md)
4. [`.codex/dispatch/demo-run.yaml`](./.codex/dispatch/demo-run.yaml)
5. [`logs/project-state/current.json`](./logs/project-state/current.json)
6. [`outputs/agent-runs/demo-run/reviewer/gate.literature-producer.json`](./outputs/agent-runs/demo-run/reviewer/gate.literature-producer.json)

## What To Notice

- The route is explained before execution.
- The agent roles are explicit.
- The reviewer is linked to a specific producer.
- The project state is written to files instead of staying hidden in chat.
- The demo intentionally stops at the planning/review boundary; it does not pretend to have completed the full research project.
