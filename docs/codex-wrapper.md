# Codex Wrapper Contract

VELA is a portable workflow wrapper around Codex. It does not replace Codex, run a hidden agent loop, or store private memory. It gives a research project a file-based operating layer that Codex can read, act within, and leave auditable results behind.

## Product Center

The center of VELA is the Codex handoff packet plus the files that make the handoff reviewable:

- `AGENTS.md` defines the local research contract.
- `.codex/commands/` keeps repeatable prompt patterns close to the project.
- `handoffs/` stores bounded tasks for Codex.
- `materials/`, `evidence/`, `claims/`, `methods/`, and `deliverables/` keep research objects separate.
- `logs/quality-gates/` and `logs/project-state/` keep project status inspectable.
- `.vela/context.json` exposes the current state to HELM and other readers.

## Default Loop

```text
initialize project -> create handoff -> lint handoff -> give prompt to Codex -> validate result -> record human review
```

VELA defaults to rendering prompts and validation reports. It should not silently execute Codex tasks unless the user explicitly chooses an execution bridge later.

## Layers

| Layer | VELA responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Project scaffold | Create the folder and file shape from `package/.vela/initializer-manifest.json` |
| Codex instruction | Provide concise `AGENTS.md` and command templates |
| Handoff | Turn a task into a small, named, reviewable contract |
| Validation | Check structure, handoff markers, context freshness, and quality gates |
| Audit | Preserve logs, quality reports, prompts, and human-review records |
| HELM interface | Write `.vela/context.json` for read-only dashboard import |

## Deferred Capabilities

The local research environment contains broader governance and harness ideas. VELA only absorbs them when they strengthen the public wrapper contract.

Deferred for later releases:

- privacy scan and public export command;
- dedicated evidence, claim, and deliverable validators;
- five focused VELA skills for material intake, evidence promotion, claim linking, handoff building, and deliverable review;
- optional Codex execution bridge after prompt rendering and validation are stable.

This boundary keeps VELA usable as an installable workflow package rather than a private research automation platform.
