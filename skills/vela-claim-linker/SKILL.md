# VELA Claim Linker

Use this skill to compare claims with named evidence records.

Output should distinguish:

- `supports`;
- `partially_supports`;
- `qualifies`;
- `contradicts`;
- `needs_evidence`.

Every support judgment must cite an evidence ID. If the evidence only supports a narrower claim, propose the narrower wording instead of upgrading the original claim.
