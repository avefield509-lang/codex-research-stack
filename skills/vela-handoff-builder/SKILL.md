# VELA Handoff Builder

Use this skill to create or revise a `vela.codex.handoff.v1` packet.

A valid handoff must name:

- task;
- relevant files;
- excluded files or directories;
- constraints;
- expected output format and path;
- review standard;
- validation commands;
- whether human review is required.

Keep the handoff small. If the task spans too many files or goals, split it into multiple handoffs.
